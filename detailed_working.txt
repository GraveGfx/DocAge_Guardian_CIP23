This is the detailed description about what the code does?
	

1. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries for the program. Here's a brief description of each library:
   - `tkinter`: A library for creating GUI applications.
   - `filedialog`: A module within `tkinter` that provides a file dialog box for file selection.
   - `PIL`: The Python Imaging Library, used for image processing tasks.
   - `pytesseract`: A Python wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine, which is used for extracting text from images.
   - `re`: A library for working with regular expressions, used for pattern matching.
   - `datetime`: A module for working with dates and times.
   - `timedelta`: A module within `datetime` for representing time intervals.
   - `termcolor`: A library for printing colored text in the console.
   - `pyfiglet`: A module for generating ASCII art from text.
   - `gtts`: A library to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. 
   - `pyttsx3`: Another text  to speech library, which is offline. 

2. The code creates a Tkinter window, which serves as the graphical user interface for the program.

3. The `open_file()` function is defined, which is triggered when the user clicks the "Open File" button. 
This function allows the user to select an image file using the file dialog provided
by `filedialog.askopenfilename()`.
After that a ASCII text  " Hello! Welcome to DocAge Guardian"
and then, sound play with the help of pyttsx3 offline library.

4. The selected image file is opened using the `Image.open()` function from the PIL library, 
creating an image object.

5. The `pytesseract.image_to_string()` function is called to extract text from the image. 
It uses OCR to recognize the characters in the image and convert them into text.

6. The extracted text is printed to the console using the `print()` function.

7. The code uses regular expressions (`re`) to search for a specific pattern representing the 
date of birth (DOB) in the extracted text. The pattern used is `r"DOB: (\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4})"`, 
which matches a string with the format "DOB: dd-mm-yyyy".
This pattern assumes that the DOB is preceded by the text "DOB:" and is followed by a space.

8. If a match for the DOB pattern is found in the extracted text, the code extracts the DOB using
`dob_match.group(1)`, where `dob_match` is the matched pattern object.The extracted DOB represents
the birth date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

9. The extracted DOB is printed to the console.

10. The DOB is converted to a `datetime` object using the `datetime.strptime()` function.
This function parses the DOB string and creates a `datetime` object with the specified format.
In this case, the format used is "%m-%d-%Y", which corresponds to "mm-dd-yyyy".

11. The current date is obtained using `datetime.now().date()`, which returns the current date
as a `date` object.

12. The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year and adjusting for the month
and day.This calculation takes into account whether the current month and day are before the 
birth month and day, which is achieved by usingthe expression 
`(today.month, today.day) < (dob_obj.month, dob_obj.day)`.
13. The calculated age is printed to the console.

14. Based on the age calculation, the code performs access verification. If the age is 18 or greater, 
it prints "Access Granted!" in green color using the `termcolor.cprint()` function.
If the age is less than 18, it prints "Access Denied!" in red color. 
If the DOB pattern is not found, it prints "DOB Not Found!" in yellow color.

It also include text-to-speech. in which differents text are converted to speech by using Google API gTTs
and an offline python library named as pyttsx3.

15. The code defines three functions, 

`slant_text_art_green()`, 
`slant_text_art_red()`, and 
`slant_text_art_yellow()`,
`welcome_DocAge()

which are used to generate ASCII art 
using `pyfiglet` and colorize it using `termcolor`. Each function takes a specific text as
input and generates stylized art in a slant font.

16. The Tkinter window is created with an "Open File" button. When the button is clicked, it triggers the
`open_file()` function.

17. The Tkinter event loop `window.mainloop()` is started, which keeps the window open and listens
for user interactions.

Overall, this code provides a GUI-based interface to open an image file, extract text from the 
image, identify the DOB, calculate the age, and perform access verification based on age criteria. 
It also includes ASCII art, text-to speech and colored text for visual & vocal presentation .
